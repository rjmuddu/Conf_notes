# Conf_notes

The STAReast 2015 conference had some great keynote addresses (see below for links to on-demand videos). The one on Deliberate testing in an Agile World was a great presentation that stressed on how a tester should think about various testing methods.

A number of sessions in the conference were based on Continous Integration. There were concurrent sessions, so I attended the ones that seemed relevant to my tribe's work (DataQuality). 
There were designated expo-hours during which companies gave some quick demos of testing tools. Notable among them were - SauceLabs, SmartBear (SoapUI) and MindTree's testing in the cloud. 

On the final day,I attended a workshop on Regulated Software testing where I got to interact with some folks in the industry who work in highly compliant companies. This was an open forum where we shared some best practices. One group from S&P seemed to have a very methodical process for bug tracking reports etc. During this session, some great books on software testing were discussed. You can find the links to the books below.

I recorded a couple of sessions I attended. I'll edit those recordings to remove noise etc. and post them here.
